It's amazing to start my Instructables career with telegram bot API and ESP8266. Through this project I try to depict how to control ESP8266 with telegram bot which opens to the great world of IoT.
Step 1: Installing Telegram Bot Library
Step 2:First of all download Telegram Bot library (download) and add it to Arduino IDE.
Step 3:Install Telegram on your Laptop or Phone and search for Botfather. Through Botfather create your new bot.From Botfather you can take the token which is the interaction key between device and Telegram bot API .
Step 4:Connect ESP8266 to Arduino as shown. Connect GPIO0 to ground and press reset button of Arduino and upload the code.
Step 5:Put your wifi credentials as well as bot token and upload the code
