Arduino Telegram Bot
Overview
This project is an Arduino-based Telegram bot that allows users to interact with their Arduino device via Telegram messages. The bot can receive commands, perform actions, and send status updates directly to a Telegram chat.

Features
Remote Control: Send commands to your Arduino device from anywhere using Telegram.
Status Updates: Receive real-time updates from your Arduino device.
Custom Commands: Easily add new commands to extend the bot's functionality.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Arduino IDE installed on your system
A compatible Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Arduino Mega, etc.)
An active Telegram account and bot token
Libraries for Telegram communication (e.g., Universal Telegram Bot library)
Hardware Requirements
Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Mega, etc.)
Ethernet shield or Wi-Fi module (e.g., ESP8266) for internet connectivity
USB cable for programming the Arduino
Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arduino-telegram-bot.git
cd arduino-telegram-bot
Install Arduino Libraries

Open the Arduino IDE and install the following libraries via the Library Manager:

ArduinoJson by Benoit Blanchon
UniversalTelegramBot by Brian Lough
WiFi or Ethernet library depending on your connectivity hardware
Set Up the Arduino Sketch

Open the arduino_telegram_bot.ino file in the Arduino IDE.

Configure Your Bot Token

Replace the placeholder with your actual Telegram bot token:

cpp
Copy code
#define BOT_TOKEN "your_telegram_bot_token"
Configure Network Settings

For Wi-Fi:

cpp
Copy code
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>
const char* ssid = "your_SSID";
const char* password = "your_PASSWORD";
For Ethernet:

cpp
Copy code
#include <Ethernet.h>
byte mac[] = { 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0xFE, 0xED };
IPAddress ip(192, 168, 1, 177);
Upload the Sketch

Connect your Arduino board to your computer and upload the sketch.

Running the Bot
Power the Arduino

Ensure your Arduino is powered on and connected to the internet.

Start Sending Commands

Open Telegram and search for your bot. Start sending commands to interact with your Arduino.

Usage
You can send the following commands to your bot:

/status - Get the current status of the Arduino.
/led_on - Turn on an LED connected to the Arduino.
/led_off - Turn off the LED.
/custom_command - Add and define your custom commands.
Adding Custom Commands
To add custom commands, modify the handleNewMessages function in the sketch:

cpp
Copy code
void handleNewMessages(int numNewMessages) {
  for (int i = 0; i < numNewMessages; i++) {
    String chat_id = String(bot.messages[i].chat_id);
    String text = bot.messages[i].text;

    if (text == "/custom_command") {
      // Add your custom command handling code here
      bot.sendMessage(chat_id, "Custom command executed", "");
    }
  }
}
